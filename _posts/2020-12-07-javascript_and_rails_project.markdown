My Javascript and Rails project aims to mimick how a user interacts with an online job board, in other words, it has features and functions you would find when looking for a new job. My application allows users to add a job, delete a job and search for a job. 

Over the course of this past few weeks I had the opportunity to build a single page javascript application with a rails api in the backend. One of my biggest challenges I faced while creating this application was figuring out how to handle asynchronous events between the client and the server. Handling AJAX calls and manipulating the DOM were very new concepts to me. After doing some debugging and with some guidance I was able to have my frontend communicate with my backend API to make AJAX and render the results in JSON format.

This project helped me identify my strengths and weakenesses. After looking at where I started and where I am now, I feel as though I am in a better place.
