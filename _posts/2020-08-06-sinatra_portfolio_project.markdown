One hour of code per day can save the world.

My Sinatra Portfolio Project is a precursor to an online job board. Users can sign up and post jobs as if they are the employer, and logged on users can see all the jobs posted by other users however they cannot edit or delete the job posting that is not created by that particular user.

The major problem I was having while creating this project was figuring out what I want to display to my users and how I wanted them to navigate the application.

After putting so much time and effort into this project I have come to the realization that I learn best by doing and not seeing.

This project helped me figure out how I like learning and that is why love code.
