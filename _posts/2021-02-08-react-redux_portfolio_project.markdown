Over the last six months of this program I immersed myself to new new programming languages and topics I never would have known if I had not attended the Flatiron School. My hard work and self-determination paid off when I was built my final portfolio project which is a react-redux application with a ruby on rails api. React JS and Redux are two very new concepts to me, after taking the time to embrace them and incorporate them into my codebase I began to appreciate them. 

My React-Redux project aims to create an online job board for people to find the job of their dreams. With React JS it makes it easier to create clones of any modern website as react is very flexible, declarative and efficient. By using react to create reusable interface components I was able to create a website that I am proud of using and I know that I will be able to build on in the future.
