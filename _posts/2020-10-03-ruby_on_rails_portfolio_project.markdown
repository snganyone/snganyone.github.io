Over the course of this past few weeks I got the chance to create an end-to-end web application with Ruby on Rails web development framework. Ruby on Rails makes much more fun and easy to develop web applications as it provides users with a variety of tools to make their apps more practical, requiring less code and less time debugging. When I first saw this framework, I was very concerned about defining all of my http verbs and resource requests, rails made it very easy for me to make distinctions between them and create unique end-user experiences. By making it easy to define http verbs, I was able to create an elegant user experience by creating log-in functionalities and behaviours I otherwise could not have done without ruby on rails.

What I really enjoyed about this project was getting the chance to take a more strategic approach at programming rather than having to spend time making decisions about how to create my application. What I mean by this is that rails allowed me to create my back-end and front-end features simultaneously by allowing to me specify table attributes and associations in a clear and concise manner making the app development process quicker and easier. 

If I had the chance to do this project again I would have spent more time diving into the mysteries and wonders of Rails by experimenting with its unique app generating functions and how it scaffolds applications.

Happy coding.
