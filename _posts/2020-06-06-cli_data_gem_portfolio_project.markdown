Overview:

* In this project I created a Ruby Command Line Interface (CLI) to access data from the Github Jobs API. ðŸ’¼
* My main object is to create a CLI that can provide access to data to an API, scrape it, and handle user input and output.

Design Process:

* I really wanted a CLI that can allow users to find information about a job posting they want to apply for.
* One of my hardest challenges was figuring out how to use the API and gaining access to it.
* Writing command line code and creating get requests can be a dawnting process however it paid off.
